# Current Task: Data Table Enhancements

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Make "Station ID/Pole Number" and "Description" fields editable
- ✅ Ensure edited data persists between page refreshes
- ✅ Remove sorting functionality from the data table
- ✅ Add copy functionality to export row data to Word tables

## Relevant Context
This task builds on the previous user data persistence functionality, enhancing the user experience by:
- Allowing users to edit key data fields directly in the table
- Preserving those edits across browser sessions
- Simplifying the UI by removing the sorting capability

## Implementation Details
1. Updated DataTable component:
   - Created an EditableCell component for editable fields
   - Removed sorting-related code and UI elements
   - Added onDataChange callback to communicate changes to parent component
   - Added a copy button column with clipboard functionality

2. Enhanced App component:
   - Added handleDataChange function to process updates from DataTable
   - Connected the data editing flow to localStorage persistence
   - Ensured edited data is saved immediately when changes occur

3. Copy Functionality:
   - Added a Copy button to each row using lucide-react's Copy icon
   - Implemented clipboard API to copy formatted data (tab-separated for Word tables)
   - Added visual feedback with a "Copied!" message that appears when successful
   - Formatted data specifically for compatibility with Word tables

4. TypeScript improvements:
   - Added proper type definitions for the EditableCell component
   - Created ref handling for copy feedback messages
   - Ensured type safety throughout the data editing and copying flow

## Next Steps
- Implement data visualization with charts for better data representation
- Add filtering and search capabilities for the data table
- Add comparison view between different pole loading scenarios
