# Current Task: User Selection and Persistence Implementation

## Current Objectives
- Implement user selection dropdown with predefined users
- Create data persistence across browser sessions
- Ensure each user's data remains available after browser refresh/close

## Relevant Context
This task is part of the project goals defined in the projectRoadmap.md:
- "Add user selection without requiring login"
- "Implement data persistence across browser sessions"

We have successfully implemented these features by:
1. Creating a UserSelector component that allows selecting from predefined users
2. Using localStorage to persist user selections and uploaded data
3. Building a data management system that saves each user's pole data separately

## Implementation Details
- Created a new UserSelector component for user profile selection
- Added localStorage utility functions for data persistence
- Updated App component to manage user-specific data
- Ensured data is saved when files are processed
- Implemented auto-loading of user data when changing profiles

## Next Steps
- Add data export functionality to allow users to download their processed data
- Implement data visualization with charts for better data representation
- Add filtering and search capabilities for the data table
